## Starting

- You'll find the front end in /app. There are two projects in which;

1. watcher: app for receiving incoming video, audio and screen
2. sharer: app for sharing video, audio and screen

- On `server` folder, you'll run it to start websocket server i which is responsible to delegate incoming connections

## Runing

- To run, you'll need to use the socket server URL. If empty, default is `localhost:4000`
